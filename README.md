# Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) Solver Project

## Project Description
The project for the Operations Research (OR) course involves developing a Julia program using the JuMP library to solve an optimization problem. The problem addressed is the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), a classic problem in combinatorial optimization. The objective is to compare two methods for solving the TSP on various randomly generated instances: an exact method (MTZ) and a heuristic method (Simulated Annealing). 
a
### Problem Description
The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) involves finding the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city. This project aims to implement and compare two different methods for solving the TSP:

1. **MTZ Formulation**: An exact method that uses the Miller-Tucker-Zemlin (MTZ) formulation.
2. **Simulated Annealing**: A heuristic method that approximates the solution.



### Results

Sure, here's a table summarizing the results:

Sur la base des résultats du tableau, voici quelques observations :

* L'algorithme MTZ a pu trouver la solution optimale dans toutes les instances de taille 10 et 20, et dans la plupart des instances de taille 30. Cependant, il n'a pu trouver la solution optimale dans aucune des instances de taille 50.
* Le temps nécessaire pour trouver la solution à l'aide de l'algorithme MTZ augmente considérablement avec la taille de l'instance. Par exemple, il a fallu 8774 millisecondes pour résoudre une instance de taille 10, mais il a fallu 300318 millisecondes pour résoudre une instance de taille 50, qui est la valeur max.
* L'algorithme Recuit Simulé n'a été capable de trouver de meilleures solutions que l'algorithme MTZ dans, en particulier dans celles de taille supérieur a  30 et 50.

Dans l'ensemble, ces résultats suggèrent que l'algorithme MTZ est un bon choix pour résoudre les instances de taille petite à moyenne du TSP, mais qu'il n'est peut-être pas adapté aux instances plus grandes. 
L'algorithme Recuit Simulé peut être capable de trouver lui ausi des solutions optimalque.


## Bonus

* Tests effectués avec des valeurs entre 30 et 60

Lors de tests avec des valeurs comprises entre 30 et 60, il a été observé que les algorithmes aboutissent généralement à des solutions non optimales. Cependant, dans certains cas, la valeur optimale est effectivement atteinte.
